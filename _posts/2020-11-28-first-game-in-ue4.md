Talk held online on the 28th of November 2020 for the [C++ Day 2020](https://www.italiancpp.org/event/cppday20/).

Unfortunately this was my first ever live coding event and I totally messed up the timing. I was able to just go through the basics and couldn't even show you the pawn moving, sorry!

This talk is about creating in C++ a Pawn in a vertical scrolling shooter game made with UE4: starting from scratch, I created the base class, then added input binding, some properties and the movement logic. I then created a Blueprint based on this rough implementation so that I could start defining the properties' values, such as health, soundFXs, projectiles, etc...

Please, have a look at the source code which contains the full implementation, along with the compiled binaries for you to try!
