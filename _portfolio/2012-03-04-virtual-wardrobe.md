This R&D project involved creating a customer-focused solution that allowed users to browse a digital catalogue of clothes.

Leveraging upon the work done for [TSim-X](/portfolio/2009-03-23-tsimx), our solution provided a 3D environment where, as the user dragged the clothes around, each garment moved like it was hanging from the top. Coupled with RFID technologies, the kiosk silently collects useful data that is sent to the category manager and helps understand trends, likes and dislikes for each product in the catalog.
