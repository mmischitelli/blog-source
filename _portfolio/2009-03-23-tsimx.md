Hired to improve and optimize an already developed solution, I ended up rewriting everything from scratch, making use of the famous NVIDIA PhysX library.

The application, known as TSim-X, was a user-friendly real-time CAD which used the GPU both for visual rendering and physical simulation of indoor curtains. It was developed using both C++ and C#: the former for the engine/rendering/physics part, while the latter was used to create the UI and the business logic of the software.

The rendering engine was fully compatible with OpenGL 1.3 (static rendering pipeline). On capable machines, however, supported multi-pass GLSL shaders, vertex buffer objects and multiple render targets. Implemented shaders included satin and velvet-like BRDF and a bloom shader to approximate HDR glow in high-contrast zones.

Later in the development the following technologies were implemented: touchscreen support, RFID for interactive clothing application, multi-monitor rendering, saving and reloading of scenes using XML.
