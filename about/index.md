Hello everyone, Mike here.

I've been a developer since ever. My first experience with code writing dates back at when I was 11: a friend gifted me with an old Yamaha MSX-Basic compatible computer. When turned on, it would only display a blue screen with "BASIC" printed on the first lines. Luckily, my old Arithmetics book from the primary school had some pages near the end where it explained the basic concepts of the BASIC programming language. I then started reading and playing with those commands on the old computer.. and it worked! The computer was able to perform operations and "execute" instructions: I had just learned how to program in basic!

From there, I got really passionate about computers, both regarding hardware and software. I began upgrading components on my own: those were the years of 3Dfx, Matrox, Riva, and S3 and could experience the huge difference it made having a 3D accelerator in games like Quake2, Hexen and the first Tomb Raider! This combined passion for both computers and games got me curious about using 3D graphics in computer software.

My professional career began in 2008, exactly from there: OpenGL and real-time computer graphics.
